	<h2>What are floating point numbers</h2>
	<p>As the name implies, floating point numbers are numbers that contain floating decimal points. For example, the numbers 5.5, 0.001, and -2,345.6789 are floating point numbers. Numbers that do not have decimal places are called integers.Computers recognize real numbers that contain fractions as floating point numbers. When a calculation includes a floating point number, it is called a "floating point calculation." Older computers used to have a separate floating point unit (FPU) that handled these calculations, but now the FPU is typically built into the computer's CPU.

	<h2>Floating-Point Format</h2>
	<p>Computers store floating point numbers in a specific format . As our aim is to maximize the range of numbers that can be stored .FPUs typically represent real numbers in a binary floating-point format. In this format, a real number has three parts: a sign, a significand, and an exponent. The following explaination is in accordance with the standard IEEE format of 32 bit representation .

	<table><tr><td>
	<h2>Sign Bit</h2>
	<p>
	-> 1- Bit Long
	<br/>
	-> Determines The +ve or -ve number
	</p></td><td>
	<h2>Exponent Field</h2>
	<p>-> 8 - Bits Long
	   -> Determines The Range Of Numbers That Can be Represented<br/>
	   -> Increasing The Bits Will Increase The Range, Not Precision<br/>
	   -> To Cover For -ve Numbers , exp = 127 + real exp <br/>
	</p></td></tr><tr><td>
	<h2>Mantissa Field</h2>
	<p>-> 23 - Bits Long
	   -> Determines the precision of Numbers<br/>
	   -> Increasing bits Will Increase precision , not range <br/>
	   -> More bits ....More The Accuracy <br/>
