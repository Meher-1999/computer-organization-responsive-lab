<h2>Consequence #1: Values are unevenly spaced</h2>
<p>-> Imagine we only had 6 bits for each floating-point number (1 sign, 3 mantissa, 2 exponent)<br/>

-> Means less absolute precision for numbers with larger magnitudes<br/>

-> That is why the numbers are more densed near the zero as compared to far away from the number line.

<h2>Consequence #2: Roundoff errors</h2>
<p>- > Our system can represent 6, and it can represent 0.25, but not 5.75
<br/>
 - > So 6 - 0.25 is 6, not 5.75 and if 6 - 0.25 - 0.25 - 0.25 - 0.25 is evaluated left to right, the answer is still 6
<br/>
 - > This is not random Happens exactly the same way every time
