* Objective
  - To perform the Experiment of the "Representation of Floating Point Numbers and their Arithmetic  " experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-organization-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Representation of Floating Point Numbers and their Arithmetic/Representation of Floating Point Numbers and their Arithmetic_01_Usability_smk.org][Representation of Floating Point Numbers and their Arithmetic_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Experiment page
  3. Click on the 'Click Here' link
  4. Select 'Decimal to floating point converter' option
  5. Enter the values in Decimal number field and click on submit button
  6. Click on the reset button

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. The values in the table should get highlighted which can be accurately represented
  5. An simulation result should be displayed on the screen
  6. The selected values and the result should get erased from the screen
